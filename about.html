        <h2>Meet Ali: A Life Driven by Purpose</h2>

        <p>
        For more than two decades, Ali has shown what one determined person can spark in a community.
        In 2002, he founded Spirit Riders, a motorcycle group in Charlotte, North Carolina, built on a
        simple belief — that when people come together, they can change a child’s life.
        </p>

        <p>
        Every year since, Spirit Riders has rallied hundreds of volunteers to collect toys and essentials
        for Toys for Tots, turning compassion into a local tradition of generosity.
        </p>

        <p>
        But Ali’s commitment doesn’t stop at his hometown. His heart has carried him across the world —
        to Mexico, Iran, Ukraine, and beyond — where he has helped build playgrounds for children who
        often have no safe place to simply be kids.
        </p>

        <p>
        Quietly and consistently, he has also contributed his own resources to organizations doing critical
        work globally including World Central Kitchen, World Vision, Pat’s Place Child Advocacy Center,
        St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Doctors Without Borders, and many others.
        </p>

        <p>
        Ali’s example is a cornerstone of our nonprofit’s mission. His journey reminds us that change begins
        with heart — and that one person’s compassion can ripple outward to touch children across the globe.
